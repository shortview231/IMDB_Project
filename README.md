Project Summary: Analysis of Film Ratings vs. Runtime
Introduction:
When I began this project, I had a clear assumption about the relationship between film ratings and runtime. My initial hypothesis was that the longer a film, the lower its rating would be. This assumption was driven by the idea that people have shorter attention spans, particularly in today’s fast-paced world where content consumption is typically quicker and more immediate. Additionally, I anticipated that films around the 90-minute mark would be the most favorably rated, assuming they would be the easiest for viewers to engage with and enjoy.

However, as I dug deeper into the data, I found that my assumptions did not align with the actual trends. The results were not only unexpected but also led to some valuable insights that will help inform decisions in film production, particularly for the horror genre.

Key Findings:
1. Overall Rating per Genre:
The first chart I analyzed was a breakdown of average ratings per genre. The key takeaway from this chart was that certain genres consistently scored higher ratings than others, with action, adventure, and animated films being among the top-rated categories. This observation suggested that factors like audience engagement and genre-specific expectations could influence ratings more than runtime alone.

2. Correlation of Runtime vs. Film Ratings:
The second chart I created examined the direct correlation between film runtime and its rating. Initially, I hypothesized that a longer runtime would correlate with lower ratings, as longer films tend to lose viewers' attention. However, this was not the case. In fact, films with runtimes between 2 hours and 2.5 hours (120 to 150 minutes) were rated the highest on average. This was a surprising discovery that contradicted my initial assumptions, showing that film length does not necessarily correlate with poor ratings.

The data revealed that certain films with more extensive plots, character development, and world-building (which are typical of longer films) often received better ratings. This finding made it clear that film quality, storytelling, and pacing are more important to viewers than simply the length of the film.

3. Genre-Specific Analysis – Horror Films:
As part of my deeper analysis, I focused specifically on horror films to understand how runtime affects ratings in this particular genre. Horror films, unlike other genres, rely heavily on atmosphere, tension-building, and audience engagement through suspense and fear. As such, I wanted to see if there was a pattern between the runtime and ratings in the horror genre.

The results were telling: the horror films that received the highest ratings tended to have runtimes between 120 and 150 minutes. This suggests that, contrary to popular belief that shorter horror films might work better, audiences tend to appreciate a longer runtime for horror films when it allows for richer storytelling, better character development, and more suspenseful pacing.

I found that horror films in this runtime range were able to effectively balance the need for tension and story development without overextending the audience’s patience. This finding is critical for anyone involved in the creation or production of horror films, as it offers concrete guidance on how long a film should be to maintain a favorable reception.

Conclusion:
After analyzing the data, I can confidently conclude that, contrary to my initial expectations, longer films do not necessarily lead to lower ratings. Specifically for the horror genre, films that last between 120 and 150 minutes tend to perform the best in terms of ratings. This was an unexpected but valuable insight that contradicts the common assumption that shorter films are better received by audiences.

Final Recommendations:
Horror films should aim for a runtime between 120 and 150 minutes for optimal ratings.
For other genres, it may be useful to look more closely at the balance of plot, character development, and pacing, as these factors can contribute to higher ratings regardless of runtime.
Film length should be considered alongside other critical production factors such as storytelling, pacing, and audience engagement, rather than focusing solely on the length of the film.
